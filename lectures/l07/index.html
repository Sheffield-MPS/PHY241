                    <h5>Photometric Systems</h5>
                    <p>We have already seen that astronomers use <strong>filters</strong> to isolate parts of the
                        spectrum, and so measure monochromatic flux. The amount of the spectrum that a filter allows
                        through is known as the <strong>bandpass</strong>. Filters are usually categorized into
                        narrow-band filters, which have a bandpass of order 10 nm and typically isolate a spectral line,
                        and broad-band filters, which have a bandpass of order 100 nm. The central wavelength of the
                        filter bandpass is known as the <strong>effective wavelength</strong>. Most modern filters are
                        constructed of different coloured glasses, often in conjunction with thin-film coatings to help
                        define the bandpasses and minimise reflection at the surfaces.</p>
                    <p>Photometry of a source in a set of filters provides crude spectral information about the source.
                        Well-defined sets of filters are known as <strong>photometric systems</strong>. A photometric
                        system with too many filters, each with a very narrow bandpass, would make it difficult to
                        detect sufficient photons from a source, and strong absorption/emission features in the spectrum
                        might adversely affect some of the bandpasses. Conversely, a photometric system with too few
                        filters, each with a very wide bandpass, would provide insufficient spectral information.</p>
                    <p>There are two very common photometric systems that you may encounter. The system that was most
                        widely used until recently is the <em>UBVRI</em> system, also known as the
                        Johnson-Morgan-Cousins system (see Prof Vik Dhillon's notes for an excellent discussion of the
                        <a
                            href="http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/instruments/phy217_inst_photsys.html">history
                            of this system</a>). The filters cover the whole range of optical wavelengths - <em>UBV</em>
                        covers the "Ultraviolet", "Blue" and "Visual" ranges, whilst <em>RI</em> cover the "Red" and
                        "Infrared" range. The <em>UBVRI</em> filter set is shown in <a href="#figure46">figure 46</a> below.

                    <p>As discussed in PHY104, it is common practice to refer to apparent magnitudes in a particular
                        filter by the name of the filter. If the apparent magnitude of a star in the V-band is \(m_V =
                        15.5\), this is often simply written as \(V=15.5\). The difference in magnitude between two
                        filters is called a <strong>colour index</strong>. If a star's magnitudes in two filters are
                        \(B=16.0\) and \(V=15.5\), the star has a colour index of \(B-V = 0.5\). </p>
                    <p>Although the <em>UBVRI</em> system is very widely used, it is not the only photometric system.
                        Another system you may well come across is that used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
                        This uses five filters, named <em>u'g'r'i'z'</em>. The SDSS filter set has filters with higher
                        transmissions than <em>UBVRI</em>, making them good for faint sources. The SDSS filters also
                        have minimal overlap between filters. The SDSS filter set has become the most widely used
                        photometric system in modern astronomical surveys. The SDSS filter set is shown in <a href="#figure48">figure 48</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Magnitude Systems</h5>
                    <p>We saw in the first lecture on <a href="../l05/#mags">photometry</a>, that we can only find the
                        magnitude of a star, if we <strong>already know</strong> the magnitude of the comparison star we
                        used. This leads to a chicken-and-egg situation. If we need to know the magnitude of one star to
                        find the magnitude of another, how do we get started, and measure the magnitude of the
                        comparison star? Ultimately, astronomers will have to agree to <em>define</em> the magnitude of
                        a star.</p>
                    <p>The relation between magnitudes and physical flux is
                        \[m= -2.5 \log_{10} F + c.\]
                        Therefore we can see that deciding to define the magnitude of a reference star is akin to making
                        a choice as to the value of the constant \(c\) in this equation. In practice, astronomers agree
                        on a star that has a magnitude of 0. We can then measure the magnitudes of all other stars with
                        respect to this one. This agreement on a convention about the magnitude of a given star is known
                        as a <strong>magnitude system.</strong>
                    <p>In this course, we will use "Vega magnitudes" as our magnitude system. In this system, the A0V
                        star Vega is chosen as the star who's magnitude is 0; the so-called <strong>primary
                            standard</strong>. It was chosen because it indeed does have a magnitude close to zero as
                        determined by Hipparchos' <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus#Stellar_magnitude">original magnitude
                            scale</a>, it is easily observable in the northern hemisphere for more than 6 months of the
                        year, it is non-variable, relatively nearby (and hence unreddened by interstellar dust), and it
                        has a reasonably flat and smooth optical spectrum. However, because Vega is too bright to
                        observe with modern telescopes and instruments without saturating their detectors, and because
                        it is not always observable, an all-sky network of fainter secondary standards has also been
                        defined, where the magnitude of each star relative to Vega has been carefully calibrated. Over
                        the years, refinements in the definition, number and measurement accuracy of the primary and
                        secondary standards has resulted in the apparent magnitude of Vega now being 0.03 in the V-band,
                        and it is also thought that Vega may be slightly variable, but for the purposes of this course
                        we can ignore this few per cent offset and assume it is 0 in all bands. </p>

                    <h5>Calibrating Photometry</h5>
                    <p>Previously, we saw how to <a href="../l05/#extraction">extract</a> the sky-subtracted signal from
                        an object, measured in counts, from an image. Once this has been done, it is useful to convert
                        to a magnitude in a photometric system. To see why this is important imagine two astronomers
                        observing the same star, through the same filter, but with very different telescopes. Clearly an
                        astronomer with a large telescope is going to measure more counts than the unfortunate
                        astronomer who has a small telescope. It is therefore not very meaningful to share our results
                        with others in units of counts.</p>

                    <p>Converting a measurement in counts into a calibrated magnitude involves five steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>divide the number of counts by the exposure time, to get a measure of flux in counts per
                            second;</li>
                        <li>calculate the <a href="#instmags">instrumental magnitude</a>, from the counts per second;
                        </li>
                        <li>determine the <a href="#extcoeff">extinction coefficient</a>, and correct the instrumental
                            magnitude to the above-atmosphere value;</li>
                        <li>repeat the above steps for a standard star and use the resulting above-atmosphere
                            instrumental magnitude of the standard star to calculate the zero point;</li>
                        <li>use the zero point to transform the above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude of the target
                            star to the required photometric system.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The above steps are described in more detail below.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Instrumental Magnitudes</strong></h6>
                    <a name="instmags"></a>
                    <p>Let us call the sky-subtracted signal from our target object, in counts, \(N_t\). We convert this
                        to an instrumental magnitude, using the formula
                        \[ m_{\rm inst} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( N_t / t_{\exp} \right), \]
                        where \(t_{\rm exp}\) is the exposure time of the image in seconds. The instrumental magnitude
                        depends on the characteristics of the telescope, instrument, filter and detector used to obtain
                        the data. It is therefore meaningless to compare two instrumental magnitudes taken under
                        different situations, without first putting them on a calibrated scale.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between instrumental magnitudes and calibrated magnitudes can be understood as
                        follows. The counts per second \(N_t / t_{\exp}\) is proportional to the flux, \(F_\lambda\).
                        Hence
                        \[ m_{\rm inst} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \kappa F_\lambda \right) = -2.5 \log_{10} F_\lambda +
                        c',\]
                        therefore, instrumental magnitudes are offset from calibrated magnitudes by a constant:
                        \[ m_{\rm calib}= m_{\rm inst} + m_{\rm zp},\]
                        where the constant, \(m_{\rm zp}\), is known as the <strong>zero point</strong>. The zero point
                        depends upon the telescope and filter used. We can understand this because if we used a larger
                        telescope to observe a star, the instrumental magnitude would change, but the calibrated
                        magnitude must not!
                    </p>
                    <p>A handy tip to remember about zero-points is this; an object with a calibrated magnitude equal to
                        the zero point gives one count-per-second at the telescope. For example, suppose the zeropoint
                        of a telescope/filter combination is \(m_{\rm zp} = 19.0\). If we observe a star with \(m_{\rm
                        calib}= 19.0\), then it follows that, for this star \(m_{\rm inst}=0\). By definition then, this
                        star gives one count-per-second.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Extinction</strong></h6>
                    <a name="extcoeff"></a>
                    <p>The next step is to convert the instrumental magnitude, which is measured on the surface of the
                        Earth, to the instrumental magnitude that would be observed above the atmosphere. This is
                        necessary because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs light from the star, and the amount of light
                        absorbed depends on the angle of the star above the horizon. If we didn't correct this effect,
                        observations of objects at different times of night would give different magnitudes! We'll see
                        how to correct for extinction <a href="#correct">below</a>, but first we need to work out how
                        extinction depends on the angle of the star above the horizon.</p>
                    <p>We can derive a simple equation for the extinction correction by assuming the atmosphere is a
                        series of thin plane-parallel layers. <a href="#figure49">Figure 49</a> shows such a layer, of
                        thickness \(dx\) at an altitude \(x\). The path length through the layer for light from a star
                        at a zenith distance \(z\) is equal to \(dx \,/ \cos z = dx \sec z\). The term \(\sec z\) is
                        known as the airmass, and is sometimes given the symbol \(X\). At the zenith, \(X= \sec z = 1\),
                        and this increases to a value of 2 at a zenith distance of 60&deg;. Note that the approximation
                        of the atmosphere as being plane-parallel breaks down at larger zenith distances. Due to the
                        amount of extinction, it's a bad idea to observe astronomical objects this low, so we shall not
                        worry about the curvature of the atmosphere here.</p>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>If the monochromatic flux from an object incident on the layer is \(F_\lambda\) then the flux
                        absorbed by the layer \(dF_\lambda\) will be proportional to both \(F_\lambda\) and the path
                        length through the layer. Therefore:
                        \[ dF_\lambda = - \alpha_\lambda F_\lambda \sec z \, dx,\]
                        where the constant of proportionality, \(\alpha_\lambda\) is known as the absorption
                        coefficient, with units of m-1. The absorption coefficient is a function of the composition and
                        density of the atmosphere, and hence the altitude of the layer, \(x\). We can re-arrange this
                        equation (and drop the \(\lambda\) subscripts for clarity) to give
                        \[ \frac{dF}{F} = - \sec z \, \alpha \, dx.\]
                        Integrating the equation above for \(x\) values from the top of the atmosphere, \(t\), to the
                        bottom \(b\), we obtain
                        \[ \int_t^b \frac{dF}{F} = - \sec z \int_t^b \alpha dx.\]
                        Hence
                        \[ \frac{F_b}{F_t} = \frac{F}{F_0} = \exp \left( -\sec z \int_t^b \alpha dx \right),\]
                        where for clarity we have renamed the above-atmosphere flux \(F_t = F_0\) and the flux measured
                        at the ground by the observer \(F_b = F\). Remembering that the difference between two
                        magnitudes is \(m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \log_{10} (F_1/F_2) \), we can write (via some magic with the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#Change_of_bas">change of base formula</a>),
                        \[m-m_0 = -2.5\log_{10} (F/F_0) = 2.5 \sec z \log_{10}(e) \int_t^b \alpha dx .\]
                        We <strong>define</strong> the extinction coefficient, \(k\), as:
                        \[k = 2.5 \log_{10}(e) \int_t^b \alpha dx,\]
                        to finally obtain:
                        \[ m = m_0 + k \sec z = m_0 + kX,\]
                        where \(m_0\) is the magnitude of a star observed with no extinction (i.e above the atmosphere)
                        and \(m\) is the magnitude of a star observed at the Earth's surface at zenith distance \(z\).
                        As an example, if the extinction coefficient from a site in the V-band is \(k=0.15\)
                        magnitudes/airmass then a star would appear 0.15 magnitudes fainter at the zenith than it would
                        appear above the atmosphere, and 0.3 magnitudes fainter than above the atmosphere when at a
                        zenith distance of 60&deg;.
                    </p>
                    <p>The dominant source of extinction in the atmosphere is Rayleigh scattering by air molecules. This
                        mechanism is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\), which means that extinction is much higher in the
                        blue than in the red. The extinction can also vary from night to night depending on the
                        conditions in the atmosphere, e.g. dust blown over from the Sahara can increase the extinction
                        on La Palma during the summer by up to 1 magnitude. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> lists the
                        extinction coefficients on a typical (undusty) night on La Palma in <em>UBVRI</em>. For
                        reference, the night sky brightness on La Palma when the Moon illumination is 0% (Dark), 50%
                        (Grey) and 100% (Bright) illuminated is also listed. All values in <a href="#table2">table 2</a>

                    <h6><strong>Correcting for extinction</strong></h6>
                    <a name="correct"></a>
                    <p>To measure the extinction on a particular night, it is necessary to measure the signal from a
                        non-variable star at a number of different zenith distances. Inspecting the equation \(m = m_0 +
                        k \sec z\), it can be seen that the extinction would be given by the gradient of a plot of the
                        instrumental magnitude of the star versus \(\sec z\) and the \(y\)-intercept would give the
                        above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude. Although such a plot would give the most accurate
                        answer, it is also possible to obtain an estimate of \(k\) from just two measurements of the
                        instrumental magnitude of a star at two different zenith distances: subtracting \(m_{z_1} = m_0
                        + k \sec z_1\) from \(m_{z_2} = m_0 + k \sec z_2\) eliminates \(m_0\), allowing \(k\) to be
                        derived.</p>
                    <p>Note that no explicit extinction correction is required when performing <a
                            href="../l05/#relphot">relative photometry</a>. This is because the target and comparison
                        stars are always observed at the <strong>same airmass</strong> and hence suffer the same
                        extinction. Hence, when the target signal is divided by the comparison star signal to correct
                        for transparency variations, the variation due to extinction present in the comparison star is
                        removed from the target star.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Aside: Secondary Extinction</strong></h6>
                    <p>For very accurate photometry, the wide bandpass of broad-band filters has to be taken into
                        account when correcting for extinction. Because extinction is so strongly colour dependent, a
                        blue object actually loses more light to the atmosphere than a red one. This is true even within
                        the relatively narrow wavelength range of the <em>UBVRI</em> filters. The solution is to
                        introduce a colour-dependent secondary extinction coefficient, \(k_2\), which modifies the above
                        extinction correction equation to:
                        \[ m = m_0 + k \sec z + k_2 C \sec z,\]
                        where \(C\) is the colour index, e.g. when correcting a V-band magnitude for extinction, \(C = B
                        - V\). The secondary extinction coefficient is usually of order a hundredth of a magnitude, so
                        it will be ignored for the remainder of this course.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Calibrated Magnitude</strong></h6>
                    <p>Now we can find the above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude of any object. The final step is to
                        observe a primary or secondary photometric standard star to convert to calibrated magnitudes.
                        Suppose we have measured our instrumental magnitude of the standard star, \(m_{ {\rm std},i }\).
                        We have also measured the extinction coefficient for the night, \(k\). The above-atmosphere
                        instrumental magnitude of our standard star is therefore
                        \[ m_{ {\rm std},0,i} = m_{ {\rm std},i } - kX_{\rm std} \]
                        Since the zeropoint is defined via \( m = m_i + m_{\rm zp} \) then:
                        \[m_{\rm zp} = m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},0,i} = m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},i } + kX_{\rm
                        std},\]
                        where \(m_{\rm std}\) is the calibrated magnitude of our standard star, which can be looked up
                        in a catalog.
                        The calibrated magnitude of our target star, \(m\), can then be found using:
                        \[m = m_{\rm zp} + m_{0,i} = m_{\rm zp} + m_i - kX ,\]
                        where \(m_{0,i}\) is the above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude of our target star.</p>
                    <p>Each filter in a photometric system will have a different zero point. Once the zero point has
                        been measured for a particular telescope, instrument, filter and detector combination, it should
                        remain unchanged, although dirt and the degradation of the coatings on the optics will cause
                        minor changes to the zero point on long timescales. To determine the zero points for the
                        <em>UBVRI</em> system, the photometric standards measured by <a
                            href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=II/183A">Landolt</a> can be used.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Precise Photometry: Colour Terms</strong></h6>
                    <p>For very accurate photometry, the wide bandpass of broad-band filters also has to be taken intoV
                        account when converting instrumental magnitudes to standard values. This is because the
                        telescope, instrument, filter and detector used by an observer will always have a slightly
                        different response to light as a function of wavelength than those used by the astronomers who
                        originally defined the magnitudes of the photometric standard stars. The biggest discrepancy is
                        often in the profile of the filter. <a href="#figure50">Figure 50</a> shows two <em>V</em>
                        filters used at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. The WIYN <em>V</em> filter has a
                        sharper increase in transmission on the blue side of the profile than the Bessell <em>V</em>
                        filter, allowing more light to enter from hot, blue stars than from cool, red stars. This
                        creates a systematic error that makes blue stars seem a bit brighter than red stars when
                        observed through the WIYN <em>V</em> filter.</p>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>Fortunately, it is straightforward to correct for this systematic error by observing a field with
                        many standard stars possessing a range of colours. The advantage of observing a single field is
                        that all of the stars will then be at the same airmass and hence extinction effects are
                        cancelled out. If this is not possible, you can use many observations of standard stars in
                        different fields. We have already seen that:
                        \[m_{\rm zp} = m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},0,i}.\]
                        Hence, if the telescope, instrument, filter and detector combination being used matches that of
                        the photometric system perfectly, we can write:
                        \[m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},0,i} - m_{\rm zp} = 0.\]
                        In practice, however, the observer's equipment is never identical to that used to define the
                        photometric system, resulting in the above equation being modified to:
                        \[m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},0,i} - m_{\rm zp} = c C,\]
                        where \(c\) is the colour term, and \(C\) is the colour index (e.g \(B-V\)). Hence, the colour
                        term is equal to the gradient in a plot of \(m_{\rm std} - m_{ {\rm std},0,i} - m_{\rm zp}\)
                        against \(C\), i.e a plot of the difference between the catalogue magnitudes of the standard
                        stars and their calibrated magnitudes as a function of colour; the \(y\) intercept is set to
                        zero by using a zero point calculated from a star of \(B - V = 0\). An example of such a plot is
                        shown in <a href="#figure51">figure 51</a>, which has a gradient of 0.072. You can see from this
                        plot that use of colour terms are necessary to obtain accuracies of order 0.01 magnitudes (i.e
                        1% in flux). If your requirements are less accurate, you can ignore colour terms, as we will do
                        for the remainder of this course.</p>
