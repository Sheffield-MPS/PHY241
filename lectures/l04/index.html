                    <h5>Simple Imaging</h5>
                    <p>Imagers are instruments capable of forming images of sources. The simplest imager is when we
                        simply place a multi-pixel detector, such as a CCD, at the focal plane of the telescope.
                        Usually, a filter wheel is placed in front of the detector, as shown in <a href="#figure33">figure 33</a>.</p>
                    <p>Focusing a simple imager is accomplished either by moving the detector itself backward and
                        forward until it is in the focal plane, or by moving the secondary mirror towards or away from
                        the primary mirror. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="cell small-10">
                    <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x align-center"><div class="cell small-12 medium-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="files/small_4140.png"></div></div><div class="cell small-12 medium-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="files/small_4141.jpg"></div></div><div class="cell"><figure id="figure 33"><figcaption><strong>Figure 33:</strong> <strong class='show-for-medium'>Left: </strong><strong class='hide-for-medium'>Top: </strong>a simple imager, where a detector is placed at the focal place.

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>Since the filter in a simple imager is in the converging beam from the telescope, it causes the
                        focal plane to move away from the primary, as shown in <a href="#figure33">figure 33</a>. Every time
                        the filter is changed, the focus must be adjusted. The only way round this is by ensuring that
                        the filters all have the same optical thickness, i.e. the product of the physical thickness and
                        refractive index of each filter in the wheel is the same. In this case all the filters affect
                        the focus position equally. </p>

                    <h5>Focal Reducers/Enlargers</h5>
                    <p>The issue with simple imagers is that they rely on the native <a
                            href="../l02/index.html#platescale">plate scale</a>. This may be wholly unsuitable. For
                        example a telescope with a focal length of 40m (say a 4m \(f/10\) Cassegrain) will have a plate
                        scale of 5 arcseconds/mm. Typical CCDs are 2000 pixels across, and each pixel is 13 \(\mu\)m, so
                        the total size of a CCD is around 25mm. The FoV of a simple imager would be around 2 arcminutes,
                        which is no use for wide-field use. In addition, each pixel would only be 0.06". If the seeing
                        was 1", we would have roughly 17 pixels across the seeing disc. Such a setup is non-optimal.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Optimal CCD Sampling</strong></h6>
                    <p>How many pixels should there be in the seeing disc? In the example above, we were spreading the
                        light out over a disc of diameter 17 pixels. Each pixel has <a
                            href="../l06/index.html#readout">read noise</a>, so this means lots of read noise for
                        every star! On the other hand, if the pixels were larger than the seeing disc, the size of our
                        stars would be set by our pixel size, and not the seeing - we are throwing away spatial
                        resolution. As a compromise, it is common for instruments to be built so that the typical seeing
                        disc is sampled by two pixels. But how do we achieve that? Replacing the telescope for one of a
                        shorterfocal length, or the detector for one with more and/or larger pixels, is usually neither
                        apractical nor economical solution, so what can be done?</p>

A positive optical element acts to shorten the focal length of the telescope. This reduces the magnification, enlarges the field of view and increases the \(f\)-ratio.

                <div class="cell small-12 medium-6">
                    <p>One possibility is to use a focal reducer. This is a positive lens (or combination of lenses)
                        which is usually placed in front of the focal plane, in the converging beam from the telescope,
                        as shown in <a class="show-for-medium" href="#figure34">figure 34 (left)</a><a class="hide-for-medium" href="#figure34">figure 34 (above)</a>. The lens acts to shorten the focal length
                        of the telescope, resulting in a larger plate scale and hence a larger field of view. We might
                        also wish to use the opposite of a focal reducer - the focal extender or Barlow lens - which has
                        negative optical power and acts to lengthen the focal length of the telescope, and hence
                        decrease the plate scale and field of view.</p>
                    <p>Note that although the focal plane is shifted by a focal reducer or extender, this shift is not
                        the same as the change in the focal length. This seems odd, but remember the example of a filter
                        in a simple imager (<a href="#figure33">figure 33</a>). A filter has no optical power, and cannot
                        change the overall focal length. Yet, a filter in a converging beam affects the location of the
                        focal plane. </p>

                    <h5>Re-imagers</h5>
                    <p>Focal reducers and extenders are common on amateur telescopes. On professional telescopes, a more
                        complex method of changing the plate scale, known as a re-imager is employed. Re-imagers have
                        several advantages over other methods, which we'll describe below. First though, it helps to
                        look at how they work. A re-imager is shown in <a href="#figure35">figure 35</a>. A collimator is used to
                        make the telescope's diverging beam parallel. The parallel beam then passes through the filter
                        before being re-focussed onto the detector using a camera lens.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of the re-imager arise from the fact that the filter and any additional optics are
                        placed in a parallel beam. Thus, there change of focus if filters of different optical thickness
                        are used, and no optical aberrations are introduced. The collimated beam is also easier to
                        control than a diverging/converging beam. This makes it easy to add additional optics - for
                        example to make a spectrograph, or a multi-coloured imager like ULTRACAM (<a href="#figure36">figure 36</a>).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cell small-10">
                    <figure id="figure35"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="files/small_4374.png"></div><figcaption><strong>Figure 35:</strong> a schematic of a re-imager. The plate scale at the camera focal plane is different to the plate scale at the telescope focal plane due to the action of the collimator and camera lens. Note the position of the filter, which allows for the smallest filter to be used, whilst still allowing all rays that pass through the telescope aperture to pass through the filter.</figcaption></figure>
                </div>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>The optical design of a re-imager is shown above in <a href="#figure35">figure 35</a>. We can see that our
                        two stars are separated by a distance \(s_{\rm tel}\) in the telescope focal plane, where
                        \(s_{\rm tel} = F_{\rm tel} \theta_1 = F_{\rm coll} \theta_2\). In the camera focal plane, where
                        we place the detector, the same two stars are separated by a distance \(s_{\rm cam} = F_{\rm
                        cam} \theta_2\). We can define a magnification for our re-imager by
                        \[ M_r = s_{\rm cam}/s_{\rm tel}.\]
                        With this definition, if \(M_r < 1\) we have a focal reducer (a de-magnifier), and if \(M_r> 1\)
                            we have a focal extender. We can derive a different expression for \(M_r\) as follows:
                            \[M_r = s_{\rm cam}/s_{\rm tel} = F_{\rm cam} \theta_2 / F_{\rm coll} \theta_2 = F_{\rm cam}
                            / F_{\rm coll}.\]</p>
                    <p>The magnification of a re-imager can thus be tuned by carefully selecting the focal lengths of
                        the camera and collimator lenses. For \(M \lt 1\) we have a focal reducer (a de-magnifier).
                        For most large telescopes, this is what we require. This is because, as shown above, the
                        platescales of large telescopes are such that they will have very small fields-of-view without
                        some de-magnification.
