            <p>As part of PHY241, you will be expected to complete a simple observing project using the 16-inch
                telescope on the roof of the Hicks Building. This project is designed to give you basic hands-on
                experience of astronomical observing and data reduction, and can be completed in a few hours of
                telescope time. The observing must be done in groups of <strong>up to seven</strong> students.
                <strong>You must sign up to a group on Blackboard by the end of week 1</strong> <span
                    style="color:#CC3300;font-weight:bold">Friday 30 September 2022</span>. If you do not, I will
                assign people into groups at random.
            </p>
            <p>There are three aspects to the observing project.</p>

                    <p>Well before your scheduled observing run, you choose which open cluster to observe. You
                        will find the specifications of the <a
                            href="https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/astronomy/hicks-observatory">Hicks
                            Observatory</a> useful in your planning and when writing your report. <strong>You
                            will need to include a section on your planning in the final report.</strong> This
                        section must contain a calculation of the transit time and the transit altitude of your
                        chosen object. You may find the positional astronomy notes from PHY127 of use.
                    </p>
                    <p>A suitable open cluster must be:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>old enough so that some stars have turned off the main sequence;</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>close by, so that the stars that have turned off the main sequence are
                            <strong>bright enough</strong> to observe with the 16-inch telescope from Sheffield;
                        </li>
                        <li>small enough in anguilar size to fit within the field of view of the 16-inch
                            telescope with the focal reducer;</li>
                        <li>visible from Sheffield in the months of October and November.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>I give more detail about these points below.</p>

                                        quantitative number on this, but for now, just know that you want the
                                        stars at the main sequence turn off point to have a V-band brightness of
                                        V < 13 to 14. </p>

                        before you observe, and email Stuart Littlefair and Paul Kerry to inform them of your
                        group number and cluster choice. If you wish to observe a different open cluster, that
                        is fine, as long as it meets the criteria above.</p>

                    <p>Your observing session will be remote, via Blackboard Collaborate or Google Meet, and will be
                        supervised by Paul Kerry or Stuart Littlefair. It must be completed in a specified period: <span
                            style="color:#CC3300;font-weight:bold">Mon 10 October - Friday, 09 November 2022</span>
                        (weeks 3-7), although please note that observing is not possible over weekends and there may be
                        short periods when either myself or Paul Kerry is unavailable. </p>
                    <p>Sign-up is done using the online sign-up sheet; there is a link to this on Blackboard. Paul Kerry
                        or myself will contact you in advance if observing will be carried out; please read the full
                        instructions on how observing works (you can find this on Blackboard). Although you should be
                        able to complete all your observations in a single session, to allow for the vagaries of British
                        weather we expect you to sign up for <span style="color:#CC3300;font-weight:bold">at least two
                            evenings per week</span> until you have successfully completed your observing. If you cannot
                        do this, you must discuss the problem with me or Paul Kerry before the start of the designated
                        observing period, or as soon as the problem (e.g. illness) becomes apparent. <strong>Note that
                            reading week is not a holiday</strong>. We expect you to sign up during reading week as
                        usual.</p>
                    <p>Attendance at the observing is <span style="color:#CC3300;font-weight:bold">compulsory</span> -
                        you will not receive any marks for the project if you fail to show up or if you have not made
                        every effort to sign up for regular time slots. Note that, unless previously agreed with me or
                        Paul Kerry, if you are unable to attend a successful observing session with the other members of
                        your group, it will not be possible for you to observe at a later date on your own. Note also
                        that <strong>no resit of the observing project is possible unless you have observed</strong>, so
                        missing it will make it much more difficult to pass the module.</p>
                    <p>We strongly advise signing up for observing as soon as possible: students who fail this module
                        tend to be those who leave signing up until the last minute and then suffer from poor weather at
                        the end of the observing period. This is no excuse, as there are usually clear periods at the
                        start of the observing period which no students sign up for. Only if the entire period is
                        unusable, or if you have genuinely serious reasons as to why you could not do the observations
                        (which in most cases must be supported by documentary evidence), will this component not count
                        towards the final mark.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>After you have obtained your observations, we will work through the data reduction and analysis
                        during the PHY241 computer labs. Note that this element of the project, and the subsequent
                        write-up, must be your own work - do not work in your observing groups. </p>
                    <p>Your write-up should be similar to a <a
                            href="http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/info/labreport.pdf">formal
                            laboratory report</a>. There must be sections describing the planning stage, the
                        observations (a description of the equipment used, the observing conditions and the data that
                        was taken), the data reduction and the data analysis. You will be penalised if you omit an
                        analysis of the errors, and if you fail to compare your results with literature values. Some
                        advice on how to write the report is <a href="../resources/guidelines.pdf">here</a>, and the
                        rubric used to mark the report is <a href="../resources/rubric.pdf">here</a>. I strongly
                        recommend peer marking each other's reports with this advice and rubric in mind.</p>
                    <p>You may well want to prepare your reports using the Jupyter notebook - it is possible to produce
                        PDF documents from the notebook. Please submit electronic copies on Blackboard: the deadline is
                        <span style="color:#CC3300;font-weight:bold">Friday 16th December 2022 (16:00)</span>. Note that
                        this deadline is the final week of term, and has been set to make the observing window as long
                        as possible. However, you will undoubtedly have <strong>other pieces of work to hand in around
                            this time</strong>, so it is in your interests to complete your observing and hand in your
                        report as early as possible in the semester.
