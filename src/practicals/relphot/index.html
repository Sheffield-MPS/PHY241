        <div class="cell">
            <p>In this practical you will learn to do relative photometry on astronomical data. Our example dataset will
                be data on the <a href="http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delsct">delta-Scuti</a> star <a
                    href="http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delsct">SZ Lyn</a>. The data was taken by third-year students using
                the department's remote controlled 10-inch telescope, <a
                    href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/physics/teaching/astronomy/robodome">ROSA</a>. </p>


            <p>We know how to do aperture photometry in <a href="../../lectures/l05/">principle</a>. In practice, there
                are many software packages available to perform aperture photometry. We will analyse our images using
                <a href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/">AstroImageJ</a>. This software package
                is freely available, runs on Windows, Linux and OS X and does not have a steep learning curve.
            </p>
            <p>There is a Python <a href="http://photutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">library</a> designed for
                performing photometry on images. However, it’s use can be quite complex, so we’ll focus on using easier
                tools!</p>

            <h5>The Data</h5>
            <p>You will need a <strong>copy</strong> of the data. The data files can be found using Windows Explorer at
                <kbd>ThisPC/shared/Student/PHY_Share/Public/PHY241/SZLyn</kbd>. There are 427 images of SZ Lyn, taken
                over several hours. Each image is stored in a file format called FITS format, and end in the .fit
                extension. FITS format is the standard image format for astronomical data. Inside one file is both the
                image, and a <strong>header</strong>, which contains metadata about the image - such as when it was
                taken, and what filter the data was taken in.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Do not copy</strong> the SZ Lyn FITS files to your shared folders (U: drive). The data is nearly
                half a gigabyte, and will fill your allocation of networked drive space! </p>
            <p>Instead, copy the SZ Lyn folder to C:/MyFolder/phxxxx, where "phyxxx" is your University username. This
                copies the files to the hard drive of the machine you are sitting in front of, for rapid access.
                <strong>You MUST delete anything you place in this directory at the end of the session</strong>.
            </p>

            <h5>The Software</h5>
            <p>Instructions for installing AstroImageJ are below. Should you ever want to download a copy for your own
                machine, it is available for download <a
                    href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/">here</a>. A detailed and helpful manual
                is available <a
                    href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/guide/AstroImageJ_User_Guide_2.1.4.pdf">here</a>.
                If you encounter difficulty, or do not understand a setting, <strong>check the manual</strong>.</p>

            <div class="callout primary">
                <p><strong>Task 0:</strong> Install AstroImageJ. Using Windows Explorer, copy the ZIP file
                    fromAstroImageJ\AstroImageJ.exe
                    <kbd>ThisPC/shared/Student/PHY_Share/Public</kbd> , and save it on your computer. Locate the file in
                    Windows Explorer, right-click and choose <kbd>"Extract All"</kbd>. This will create a folder
                    starting with AstroImageJ. Inside that folder is <strong>another</strong> folder called AstroImageJ.
                    You can run the program by double-clicking on <kbd>AstroImageJ\AstroImageJ.exe</kbd>.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may get several windows asking for permission to run the program. Click
                    "OK" to these. If you get a window requesting permission for AstroImageJ to get through a
                    <strong>FireWall</strong>, click <strong>cancel</strong> on that window <strong>only</strong>.

                    AstroImageJ will not be able to calculate the image shift. Set this value to somewhere in the range

            <p>Now it is time to perform the relative photometry on the aligned images. Recall that aperture photometry
                involves three steps, centroiding, sky background estimation and extraction of the counts from our
                object. AstroImageJ performs all three of these steps with the Multi-Aperture Photometry tool. First
                however, we need to know how large to make our object apertures, and the inner and outer radius of our
                sky annulus. To do that we need to know what the FWHM of the stars in our image is.</p>

            <p>Now you have successfully learnt to use AstroImageJ for aperture photometry. However there are two issues
                remaining. The first is that your lightcurve does not have accurate error bars. The second is that you
                do not know if you used the best aperture sizes. Before we can calculate error bars we need to know more
                about how CCDs work. We will cover that later in the course.</p>
            <p>However, we can fix the second problem.</p>

                <p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Re-run your aperture photometry with a few different aperture sizes, and
                    save the results. You will need to <kbd>Clear</kbd> the Measurements table each time. Leave the sky
                    annulus unchanged for now, and simply change the object aperture radius.</p>
                <p>For your new measurements plot <strong>JD</strong> vs <strong>rel_flux_T1</strong> in each case. Try
                    to plot them on the same graph, and add a small offset to each dataset in y, so you can see the
                    curves. </p>
                <p>Which aperture size is best? What does the light curve look like when the object aperture is too
                    small? What happens when it is too big? <strong>See if you can understand these effects.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>One final thing to think about - if you use a small aperture radius like 2 pixels, much of the light
                    from your object is falling outside your aperture. Why do you still get a reasonable lightcurve?</p>
